Task for Android course
This project is about to create a program which read numbers from files with "in_*.dat" signature and
invoke mathematic operations with numbers in the second line of file according to the number in the first line of file:
case 1 - sum
case 2 - multiplication
case 3 - sum of sqares.
Each calculation must be invoked in different threads then the main thread must take all the result, sum it and write to the
"out.dat" file.
